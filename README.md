<p> I am deeply passionate about programming, a pursuit that has become not just a profession but a profound interest that drives me to explore and innovate. 
  My primary focus lies in crafting desktop and mobile applications, occasionally websites and simple games.
  One of my favourite technologies is .NET, an adaptable platform that enables me to create scalable, efficient, and feature-rich solutions.
  I am always on the lookout for emerging technologies, coding techniques, and best practices. </p>
